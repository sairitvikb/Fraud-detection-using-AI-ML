## Dataset

[Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)  
- 284,807 transactions, only 492 fraud (≈ 0.17%)  
- Features: Time, Amount, anonymized V1–V28, and Class (fraud label)

## Outcomes & Improvement Metrics

- **Significant uplift in fraud detection:**  
  - Random Forest Classifier achieved ROC-AUC scores above **0.97**, indicating excellent discrimination between fraud and legitimate transactions.
  - Precision and recall balanced: e.g., *Recall* > 0.90 for fraud class, demonstrating that the model successfully captures most fraudulent transactions with minimal false negatives.
  - Demonstrated, via confusion matrix and F1-score, improved fraud identification compared to baseline models (such as Decision Tree).
- **Precision vs. Recall trade-off visualized:**  
  - Showed model tuning impact, enabling stakeholders to choose the right balance between catching more fraud and limiting false alarms.
- **Reusable pipeline:**  
  - Notebook structure and code ready for future model deployment and enhancement.
